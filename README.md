# LU_Make_Easy 

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
LU_Make_Easy is an Android-based application designed to alleviate students' challenges with applying for partial payments and makeup examinations.


Partial Payment is a convenient process that allows students to pay half or a selected amount of the total tuition fees if they are unable to pay the full fees at once. To avail this option, students are required to seek permission from the department head, complete the necessary registration procedures, and comply with other related formalities.

Makeup exam is another essential feature of the application. It enables students who couldn't attend any midterm or final exams on the scheduled dates due to valid reasons supported by relevant documents to sit for a makeup exam. This process eliminates the need for students to individually coordinate with course teachers, department heads, and exam controllers.

By introducing this application, we aim to streamline the above-mentioned processes and provide a user-friendly platform that simplifies the application for partial payment and makeup examinations. This will significantly reduce the administrative burden on students and facilitate a more efficient and seamless academic experience.
